        <h2>What to Eat After a Workout for Nutrition and Muscle Recovery</h2>
        <p>Eating foods containing carbs and protein may help support your muscles after exercise. Experts recommend eating shortly after your workout for the most benefit.
            <br>Consuming the right nutrients after exercise can help you optimize your fitness goals.
            <br>During exercise, your muscles use upTrusted Source their glycogen, which is the body’s preferred fuel source. This results in your muscles being partially depleted of glycogen. Some of the proteins in your muscles can also be broken down and damaged during exercise.
            <br>After your workout, your body rebuilds glycogen stores and regrows those muscle proteins.
            <br>However, research suggests that eating the right nutrients soon after exercising can help your body do this faster. Properly fuelling your body after exercise can also help:
            <ul><li>decrease muscle protein breakdown</li>
            <li>increase muscle protein synthesis (growth)</li>
            <li>improve your mood</li>
            <li>enhance recovery</li>
        </ul></p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"><h3>Macronutrients for post-workout recovery</h3>
                <p>Macronutrients are a group of nutrients your body needs in large quantitiesTrusted Source to provide the necessary energy it needs to function.
                    <br>The three macronutrients are protein, carbs, and fat. These may each play a role in your body’s post-workout recovery process.
                    </p></div>
                    <div class="column"><h3>Protein helps repair and build muscle</h3>
                        <p>Exercise triggers the breakdownTrusted Source of muscle protein. The rate at which this happens depends on several factors, such as training volume, intensity, and frequency.
                            <br>Consuming an adequate amount of protein throughout the day gives your body the amino acids it needs to repair and rebuild these proteins. It also gives you the building blocks required to build new muscle tissue.
                            <br>The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) recommends consuming 20 to 40 grams (g) of protein every 3 to 4 hours. This may help improve your exercise performance, muscle recovery, and body composition.
                            <br>It’s also important to consume protein before and after exercise.
                            <br>A 2017 studyTrusted Source found that eating protein pre-workout and post-workout has a similar effect on muscle strength, hypertrophy, and body composition changes.
                            <br>Eating protein before exercise may also decrease the amount you need to eat after without affecting recovery.
                            <br>However, if you’re specifically aiming to build muscle, the ISSN recommends eating high quality protein within the first 2 hours after working out to stimulate the building blocks for new muscle tissue.
                            </p></div>
            <div class="column"><h3>Carbs help with recovery</h3>
            <p>Your body’s glycogen stores are used as fuel during exercise, and consuming carbs after your workout helps replenish them.
                <br>The rate at which your glycogen stores are used depends on the activity.
                <br>For example, endurance sports cause your body to use moreTrusted Source glycogen than resistance training. For this reason, if you participate in endurance sports like cycling and running, you might need to consume more carbs than someone engaging in weightlifting.
                <br>The ISSN recommends eating a high carb diet of 3.6 to 5.5 g of carbs per pound (8 to 12 g per kilogram [kg]) of body weight each day to help maximize your glycogen stores.
                <br>Furthermore, insulin secretion, which promotes glycogen synthesis, may be better stimulatedTrusted Source when carbs and protein are consumed at the same time.
                <br>Within the first 4 hours after working out, the ISSN recommends consuming 0.4 g of carbs per pound of body weight (0.8 g of carbs per kg) with 0.1 to 0.2 g of protein per pound of body weight (0.2 to 0.4 g of protein per kg) during each hour to help restore glycogen faster.
                <br>That said, these recommendations are targeted to the needs of endurance athletes. You may need less if you’re focusing on resistance training.
                     </p></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"><h3>Fat may provide some benefits</h3>
            <p>According to the ISSN, not enough evidence suggests whether you should limit fat intake after a workout.
                <br>Many people think that eating fat after a workout slows digestion and inhibits the absorption of nutrients. While fat might slow down the absorption of your post-workout meal, it may not reduce its benefits.
                <br>For example, a 2006 studyTrusted Source showed that whole milk was more effective at promoting muscle growth after a workout than skim milk.
                <br>Similarly, a 2017 studyTrusted Source found that eating whole eggs instead of egg whites was more effective at promoting muscle protein synthesis post-workout.
                <br>Having some fat in your post-workout meal may not affect your recovery. But more studies are needed on this topic.
            </p></div>
            <div class="column"><h3>The timing of your post-workout meal matters</h3>
                <p>The timing of your meals is important to maximize recovery and muscle growth because your body’s ability to rebuild glycogen and protein is enhanced after exercise.
                    <br>Sports nutrition researchers have been studying nutrient timing for more than 40 years.
                    <br>In the past, experts recommended eating your post-workout meal within 45 to 60 minutesTrusted Source. It was believed that delaying carb consumption by as little as 2 hours after a workout could lead to as much as 50%Trusted Source lower rates of glycogen synthesis.
                    <br>However, more recent researchTrusted Source suggests the post-exercise window to maximize the muscular response to eating protein is wider than initially thought, up to as many as several hours.
                    <br>Consuming a meal rich in whole carbs and protein before exercising may also increase your post-workout food intake window, as you may still feel some of the benefits of the pre-workout meal.
                    
                    
                </p></div>
            <div class="column"><h3>Make sure to drink plenty of water</h3>
                    <p>Staying properly hydrated before and after your workout ensures the optimal internal environment for your body to maximize results.
                        <br>During exercise, you lose water and electrolytes through sweat. Replenishing these after a workout can help withTrusted Source recovery, performance, and injury prevention.
                        <br>The National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA) recommends drinking 500 to 600 mlTrusted Source of water within 2 to 3 hours before exercising, and 200 to 300 ml within 10 to 20 minutes of exercising.
                        <br>After exercising, the NATA recommends re-filling what you lost during your workout.

        <h2>Pre-Workout Nutrition: What to Eat Before a Workout</h2>
        <p>Pairing carbs with protein before workouts can help improve performance and recovery. Staying hydrated is also important and certain supplements like creatine or caffeine might be beneficial.
            <br>Athletes and fitness enthusiasts are always looking for ways to improve their performance and achieve their goals.
            <br>Good nutrition can help your body perform better and recover faster after each workout.
            <br>Optimal nutrient intake prior to exercise will not only help you maximize your performance but also minimize muscle damage 
            <br>Here is everything you need to know about pre-workout nutrition.

            <div class="column"><h3>Carbs</h3>
                <p>Your muscles use the glucose from carbs for fuel.
                    <br>Glycogen is the way the body processes and stores glucose, mainly in the liver and muscles.
                    <br>For short and high intensity exercise, your glycogen stores are your muscles’ main source of energy.
                    <br>But for longer exercises, the degree to which carbs are used depends on several factors. These include the intensity, type of training, and your overall diet 
                    <br>Your muscles’ glycogen stores are limited. As these stores become depleted, your output and intensity diminish.
                    <br>Studies have consistently shown that carbs can increase glycogen stores and utilization while boosting carb oxidation during exercise .
                    <br>Carb loading, which involves consuming a high carb diet for 1–7 days, is a well-known method to maximize glycogen stores.

            <div class="column"><h3>Protein</h3>
            <p>Protein
                <br>Many studies have documented the potential of pre-workout protein consumption to improve athletic performance.
                <br>Eating protein (alone or with carbs) prior to exercise has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis .
                <br>One small study found that consuming 25 grams (g) of whey protein before exercise enhanced whole body anabolism, or muscle growth, compared to a placebo .
                <br>Other benefits of eating protein before exercise include:
                <ul><li>increased muscle mass</li>
                <li>improved muscle recovery</li>
                <li>increased strength and lean body mass</li>

            </p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"><h3>Fat</h3>
                <p>While glycogen is used for short and high intensity bouts of exercise, fat is the source of fuel for longer and moderate-to-low intensity exercise .
                    <br>Some studies have investigated the effects of fat intake on athletic performance. However, these studies looked at high fat diets over a long period, rather than prior to exercise .
                    <br>For example, one review found that following a low carb, high fat diet could improve body composition and increase maximal oxygen uptake when paired with high intensity interval training (HIIT) .
                    <br>Summary
                    <br>Carbs help maximize glycogen stores for high intensity exercise, while fat helps fuel your body for longer, less intense workouts. Meanwhile, protein improves muscle protein synthesis and aids recovery.

                    <div class="column"><h3>The timing of your pre-workout meal is key</h3>
                        <p>The timing of your meal is also an important aspect of pre-exercise nutrition.
                            <br>To maximize the results of your training, try to eat a complete meal containing carbs, protein, and fat 2–3 hours before you exercise.
                            <br>This is especially important for longer workouts, as evidence suggests that pre-exercise meals don’t significantly impact performance during workouts with a duration of less than 1.
                            <br>However, in some cases, you may not be able to get in a full meal 2–3 hours before working out.
                            <br>In that case, then you can still eat a decent pre-workout meal. However, keep in mind that the sooner you eat before your workout, the smaller and simpler the meal should be.
                            <br>If you eat 45–60 minutes prior to your workout, choose foods that are simple to digest and contain mainly carbs and some protein.
                            <br>This will help prevent any stomach discomfort during exercise.

                            <br>A good rule of thumb is to eat a mixture of carbs and protein prior to exercise.
                            <br>Here are some examples of balanced pre-workout meals:
                           <br> If your workout starts within 2–3 hours or more
<ul><li>sandwich on whole-grain bread, lean protein, and a side salad</li>
<li>egg omelet and whole-grain toast topped with avocado spread and a cup of fruit</li>
<li>lean protein, brown rice, and roasted vegetables</li></ul>
If your workout starts within 2 hours
<ul><li>protein smoothie made with milk, protein powder, banana, and mixed berries</li>
<li>whole-grain cereal and milk</li>
<li>a cup of oatmeal topped with banana and sliced almonds</li>
<li>natural almond butter and fruit preserve sandwich on whole-grain bread</li></ul>
<br>If your workout starts within an hour or less
<ul><li>Greek yogurt and fruit</li>

        <h2>Supplements can also be useful before exercise</h2>
        <p>Supplement use is common in sports. These products may enhance performance, improve strength, increase lean body mass, and reduce fatigue.
           <br>Below are some of the best pre-workout supplements.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <div class="column"><h3>Creatine</h3>
<br>Creatine is probably the most commonly used sports supplement.
<br>It has been shown to increase muscle mass, muscle fiber size, muscle strength, and power, all while delaying fatigue .
<br>Even though it’s beneficial to take creatine before a workout, it seems to be even more effective when taken after a workout .
<br>Taking 3–5 g of creatine monohydrate per day is effective,</div>
<div class="column"><h3>Caffeine</h3>
<br>Among many other benefits, caffeine has been shown to improve performance, increase strength and power, help reduce feelings of fatigue, and stimulate fat burning.
<br>Caffeine can be consumed in coffee, tea, and energy drinks, but it can also be found in pre-workout supplements and pills.
<br>It doesn’t really matter how you consume it, as its effects on performance are usually the same.
<br>Caffeine’s peak effects are seen 90 minutes after consumption. However, it has been shown to be effective even when ingested 15–60 minutes prior to exercise .</div>
<div class="column"><h3>Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)</h3>
    <br>BCAAs refer to the essential amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine.
    <br>Studies have shown that taking BCAAs before workouts helps decrease muscle damage and increase muscle protein synthesis .
    <br>Most benefits of BCAAs have been observed in doses of at least 91 milligrams (mg) per pound (lb.) of body weight, or 200 mg per kilogram (kg.
    <br>For a person that weighs 165 lbs. (75 kg), this means that you would need to consume around 15 g of BCAAs per day.</div>
    <div class="column"><h3>Beta-alanine</h3>
    <br>Beta-alanine is an amino acid that increases your muscle stores of carnosine. It has been shown to be most effective for short and high intensity exercises.
    <br>It does this by increasing exercise capacity and muscle endurance while reducing fatigue .
    <br>The recommended daily dose is 4–6 g, which should be taken for at least 2–4 weeks.</div>
    <div class="column"><h3>Multi-ingredient pre-workout supplements</h3>
    <br>Some people prefer products that contain a blend of the supplements mentioned above.
    <br>The combination of these ingredients may have synergistic effects and improve performance significantly.
    <br>Caffeine, creatine, beta-alanine, branched-chain amino acids, arginine, and B vitamins are among the most commonly used ingredients in these products .
    <br>These pre-workout supplements have been shown to increase work output, strength, endurance, anaerobic power, reaction time, focus, and alertness .
    <br>The particular dose depends on the product, but it’s generally recommended to take them about 30–45 minutes before exercise.</div>
